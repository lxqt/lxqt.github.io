The LXQt team is proud to announce the release of pcmanfm-qt 1.3.0.
The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt/releases).

Main changes:

 * Don't try to activate windows under Wayland (it isn't possible).
 * Leave the pixmap cache limit to Qt (and avoid extra CPU usage is rare cases).
 * Added a title for Desktop (for setting WM rules under some Wayland compositors).
 * Localize tab texts for special folders ("search", Applications, Computer, Network, Trash and Desktop).
 * Prevent Desktop items from shaking on config changes.
 * Remove Desktop's drop indicator on leaving Desktop.
 * Keep dragged and dropped items together on Desktop as far as possible.
