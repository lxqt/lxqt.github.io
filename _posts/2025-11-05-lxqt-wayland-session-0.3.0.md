The LXQt team announces the release of lxqt-wayland-session 0.3.0.


In addition to fixes and updates for the latest stable versions of some Wayland compositors:

 * Added `lxqt-qdbus` as a wrapper for various `qdbus` commands, to make them easier to use.
 * Used `XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland` for starting from tty.
 * Updated configurations for labwc 0.9.2, niri 25.08 and hyprland 0.51.
 * Used character classes in `sed` for freeBSD.

A full list of changes is in the CHANGELOG file.
