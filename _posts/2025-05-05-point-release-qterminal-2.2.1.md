The LXQt team announces a point releases of **QTerminal 2.2.1**.

Changes:

 * Removed the workaround for problems that some X11 WMs had with the drop-down mode because (1) it prevented exiting on closing and (2) didn't let the terminal be focused on showing under some
circumstances.

The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/qterminal/releases).
