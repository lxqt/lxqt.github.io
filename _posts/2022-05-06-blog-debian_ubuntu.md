[updated] As there are now [official backports packages](https://lubuntu.me/jammy-backports-22-04-1/) available for Ubuntu LTS 22.04 we strongly recommend to use those and therefor to disable the unofficial [ppa repository](https://launchpad.net/~severusseptimius/+archive/ubuntu/lxqt). Please never use both together.

Here are the  [unofficial LXQt 1.1.0 packages](https://github.com/severusseptimius/lxqt-1.1-debian.git) packages available for Debian testing.

This is quite good news.
