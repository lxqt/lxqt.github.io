Now there are [unofficial LXQt 1.1.0 packages](https://github.com/severusseptimius/lxqt-1.1-debian.git)
available for Debian testing and a [ppa repository](https://launchpad.net/~severusseptimius/+archive/ubuntu/lxqt) for Ubuntu _Jammy Jellyfish_ 22.04 LTS.

This is quite good news, as Debian and Debian-based distributions are unfortunately still lacking full maintainership for LXQt packages.
