LXQt version **1.2.0** has arrived in the [Lubuntu backports PPA](https://lubuntu.me/jammy-backports-22-04-1-lxqt-1-2/).

As there are now official backports packages available for **Ubuntu LTS 22.04** we recommend to use those and therefor to disable the unofficial [ppa repository](https://launchpad.net/~severusseptimius/+archive/ubuntu/lxqt) if present. Please never use both together.

The previous [unofficial LXQt 1.1.0 packages](https://github.com/severusseptimius/lxqt-1.1-debian.git) for **Debian testing** *Bookworm* are also not needed anymore as LXQt Version **1.1.0** has now arrived in the official repositories.
