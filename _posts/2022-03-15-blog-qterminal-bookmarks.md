QTerminal had always had a quite unique "bookmarks" feature but the setup was not very intuitive: the file had
to be created first, it had a hardcoded section containing not very useful bookmarks, filtering was not working
 and so on. Probably few users used it, as some issue were never reported.

 Now - among many other bugfixes in QTerminal and its dropdown twin -
 we dedicated some time to make this feature more attractive and usable to users.

 It can be used in a similar way as <code>~/.bash_aliases</code> - a really easy way to use
 longer commands or those that are hard to remember. Commands can be ordered in groups.
