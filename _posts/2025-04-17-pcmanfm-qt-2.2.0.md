The LXQt team announces the release of pcmanfm-qt 2.2.0.
The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt/releases).

Main changes:

 * Better drag-and-drop on Desktop, without displacing neighboring items as far as possible.
 * Workaround for a case of wrong wallpaper size on Wayland.
 * Support custom options for terminals.
 * Better tab sizes, for preventing small tab texts from becoming elided as far as possible.
 * Prevented going up when Backspace is kept pressed inside the transient filter-bar.
 * Handled Wayland screens by using their names and stopped using "primary screen" on Wayland because Wayland doesn't have the concept of primary screen.
 * Allow string replacement in bulk renaming, and show the bulk rename dialog again on failure:

 ![Bulk Rename Tool](../../../../../images/posts/bulk_rename.png)

 * Added context menu items for opening the containing folder in search:///.
 * Removed an old X11 workaround under Wayland.
 * Replaced qMin,qMax,qBound and qRound with standard functions.
 * Set fallback icons to support more icon sets.
 * Added Ctrl+Shift+NUMBER as the shortcut for changing the view mode.
