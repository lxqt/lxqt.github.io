The LXQt team is very proud to announce the release of LXQt 1.1.0, the Lightweight Qt Desktop Environment.

### Highlights

 * LXQt 1.1.0 depends on Qt 5.15, the last LTS version of Qt5. (Porting to Qt6 was started, but it needed a stable version of KF6.)
 * LXQt's file manager now supports the file manager DBus interface, which is used by some apps (like Firefox and Chromium) that call the default file manager to show files inside folders or do other jobs. Also, the "Recent Files" item is added to the File menu. As usual, problems are fixed and functionalities are improved.
 * The new component `xdg-desktop-portal-lxqt` is added to LXQt, as a backend implementation for `xdg-desktop-portal`. When it is installed, some non-Qt apps like Firefox can be set up to use LXQt file dialog.
 * LXQt themes are improved. A new theme and several wallpapers are added. Also, matching Qt palettes are added for a fairly uniform look and feel with Qt widget styles like Fusion. They can be found and applied in LXQt Appearance Configuration → Widget Style → Qt Palette.
 * The bookmark functionality is [improved a lot](https://lxqt-project.org/blog/2022/03/15/qterminal-bookmarks-reloaded/) in QTerminal and several (old) issues in the drop-down mode are fixed.
 * In LXQt Panel, the legacy tray icons are now shown inside Status Notifier when the System Tray plugin is enabled. That removes the problem that the legacy System Tray had with auto-hiding panels.
 * Tray icons with the charge percentage inside them are added to LXQt Power Manager.
 * A simple option is added to LXQt Session Settings for the global screen scaling.
 * Translations have received many updates.
 * And other changes that can be found in change logs of LXQt components.
