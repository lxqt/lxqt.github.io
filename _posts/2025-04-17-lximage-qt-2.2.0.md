The LXQt team announces the release of lximage-qt 2.2.0.
The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/lximage-qt/releases).

Main changes:

 * Used the device pixel ratio of the window on Wayland.
 * Fixes and workarounds for multi-screen scaling issues on Wayland.
 * Fixed an old issue in showing GIF animations with pixel ratios > 1.
 * Commented out "RememberWindowSize" from settings because it was never used (but might be used later).

A full list of changes is in the CHANGELOG file.
