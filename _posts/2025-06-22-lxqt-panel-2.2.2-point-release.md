The LXQt team announces the point release of **lxqt-panel 2.2.2**.
Automatic showing of mount popup is disabled on Wayland to circumvent an old problem of QtWayland.

In addition:

 * Fixed the rare bug about permanent task-buttons under kwin_wayland.
 * Support showing of current screen windows in the wlroots taskbar.
 * Made searching for the backend in EVs case-insensitive.
 * Added backend info to README.
