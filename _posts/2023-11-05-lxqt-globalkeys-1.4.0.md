The LXQt team is proud to announce the release of lxqt-globalkeys 1.4.0.
The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt-globalkeys/releases).

Changes:

 * Removed KWindowSystem as a direct dependency (`liblxqt` already brings KWindowSystem in as an INTERFACE_LINK dependency).
 * Added theme icon to the main window.

A full list of changes is in the CHANGELOG file.
