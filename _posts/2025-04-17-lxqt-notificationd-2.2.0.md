The LXQt team announces the release of lxqt-notificationd 2.2.0.
The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt-notificationd/releases).

Main changes:

 * Workaround for text misalignment on decreasing the notification width.
 * By default, show notifications on the leftmost/topmost screen under Wayland, as if it's the primary screen.
 * Allowed zero duration in the config GUI, which means no auto-closing without an explicit timeout.
 * Improved the texts of the section "Unattended Notifications" in the config GUI.
