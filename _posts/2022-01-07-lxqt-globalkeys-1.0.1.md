The LXQt team is proud to announce the release of lxqt-globalkeys 1.0.1.
The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt-globalkeys/releases).

Changes:

 * The asynchronous behavior of Xlib is kept intact. It guarantees that the global shortcut daemon starts correctly with the session after a change in the behavior of libx11 1.7.3.1.
