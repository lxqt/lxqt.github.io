I would like to announce the 0.3.2 release of lxqt-build-tools. There are no changes
in functionality but the package is now arch independent and meets the FHS standards.
Further more 0.11.2 lxqt-common and 0.11.3 pcmanfm-qt will be released today.
Both contain only small but important fixes that justify a point release.

In lxqt-common the dbus handling of startlxqt was fixed, in pcmanfm-qt the painting of
backgrounds ([QTBUG-54384](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-54384)) on hi-res screens.

With these releases we close the 0.11 release cycle and open the one for 0.12. In other
words: Let's break some things, happy hacking. Planned release goals are listed in
the  github project [0.12.0 Planned](https://github.com/orgs/lxde/projects/3). Please
feel free to add missed/needed things.
