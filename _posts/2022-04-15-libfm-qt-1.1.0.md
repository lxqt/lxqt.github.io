The LXQt team is proud to announce the release of libfm-qt 1.1.0.
The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/libfm-qt/releases).

Main changes:

 * Prepared libfm-qt for implementing "Recent Files".
 * Silenced Valgrind about an uninitialized value.
 * Corrected a typo that could have caused crash.
 * Prevented memory leak in `fm_search_to_gfile()`.
 * Made `selectFiles()` return bool in FolderView.
 * Fixed "Move Bookmark Down" in bookmark context menu.
 * Added some icons to bookmark context menu.
 * Fixed file association with empty `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`.
 * Do not add (null) to terminal command (with terminal emulators like Kitty,
 that don't have a special option for execution).
 * Added protected API to get the internal dialog of `FileDialog`.
 * Fixed the file count in the properties dialog of the search folder and removed
 critical GLib errors in special cases of searching.
 * Fixed MIME types cbz, cbr and rar in `archivers.list`.
 * A small cleanup for `Fm::Folder`.
