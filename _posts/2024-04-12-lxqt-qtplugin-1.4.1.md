The LXQt team announces the point release of lxqt-qtplugin 1.4.1, needed because
of a backward incompatible change in Qt6's font descriptions. It includes a
workaround which makes Qt5-based apps have correct fonts when fonts are set by
the Qt6-based LXQt 2.0.0.

The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt-qtplugin/releases).


Main changes:

 * Make accept Qt5 applications font settings by Qt6
