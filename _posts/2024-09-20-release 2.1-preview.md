Here's a overview of the coming LXQt release 2.1 due in mid November as usual. The main target is the experimental **Wayland session** but also some other improvements will be included.

### Wayland Session

A new package [lxqt-wayland-session](https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt-wayland-session) will be available to install - without it there won't be seen any changes, following the "modular" philosophy of LXQt: don't bother users with unwanted or unused things. If installed "Session Settings" will look like this:

As Wayland is quite different from X11 some features are not available and some settings are handled by the compositor and not anymore by LXQt, so you may see some messages like this:

![unsupported settings](../../../../../images/posts/unsupported.png)

Users can choose a Wayland compositor, as they chose a window manager under X11 - any wlroots-compatible compositor should work, in addition to kwin\_wayland. Hyprland, Labwc, kwin, Niri, Sway, River and Wayfire will be supported out of the box providing a basic configuration file for each of them. Using different screen lockers under Wayland including `swaylock`, `waylock` and `hyprlock` is supported too.

Currently there are 3 dedicated panel backends, xcb (X11), general wlroots and kwin\_wayland - with kwin\_wayland supporting several features like moving windows to workspaces, workspace switcher, urgency hints, and showing desktop. Other backends can be created and added in future, enabling similar features for other compositors like sending to scratchpad instead of minimizing windows, workspace pagers and else. PRs are welcome.

As some applications will not work under Wayland (e.g. redshift, some clipboard manager and else) their auto starting can be limited to X11 only, while, on the other hand, every compositor can start Wayland-only applications like `kanshi` or `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`.

There are also general fixes and workarounds for Wayland; for example, the desktop window of PCManFM-Qt has been improved for use with multi monitor setups.

For further details please consult the [Wayland Wiki](https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/wiki/ConfigWaylandSettings).

The upcoming LXQt 2.1 release can already be tested by [installing from sources](https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/wiki/Building-from-source) or, preferably, by making distro-specific packages and installing them (like AUR packages in Arch). The more testing feedback we get, the sooner we could find and fix probable problems!

### Styling Improvements
