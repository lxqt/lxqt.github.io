The LXQt Team announces a point release of libqtxdg 3.9.1.<br/>
This makes it possible to have Qt5 and Qt6 installations of `libqtxdg` alongside each other in near future.

Two changes are made to this point release of libqtxdg:

* `qtxdg-mat` has been separated from `libqtxdg` and put into [qtxdg-tools](https://github.com/lxqt/qtxdg-tools).
* The installation of config files has been made optional.

<br/>
The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/libqtxdg/releases).


<br/>
The complete list of changes is available in our CHANGELOG file.
