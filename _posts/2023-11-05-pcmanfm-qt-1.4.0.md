The LXQt team is proud to announce the release of pcmanfm-qt 1.4.0.
The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt/releases).

Main changes:

 * Check if wallpaper cache is up-to-date on reading Desktop settings (needed when the wallpaper is changed but its path and name are not).
 * Added an SVG app icon.
 * Fixed the tab order in dialogs.
 * Prevent invisible bulk renaming dialog dialog under Wayland.
 * Include the state of split view on restoring tabs of the last window. The credit goes to @riverbl for the main idea.
 * Allow users to add terminal commands.
 * Fixed `--wallpaper-mode` command-line option.
