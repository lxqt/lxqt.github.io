The LXQt team is proud to announce the release of screengrab 2.4.0.
The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/screengrab/releases).

Main changes:

 * Updated `README.md` and added a screenshot.
 * Added `screengrab.metainfo.xml`.
 * Used an SVG icon instead of the blurry PNG icon.
 * Removed global shortcuts (they weren't used anywhere).
 * Fixed several problems in calling external editors or default app.

A full list of changes is in the CHANGELOG file.
