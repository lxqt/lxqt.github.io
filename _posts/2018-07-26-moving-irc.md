The LXQt team is moving our IRC presence!

For a long time, we have used #lxde on [freenode](https://freenode.net/) as our main channel for both user support and development. This is mainly due to legacy purposes as we split from the LXDE project.

Today though, we are moving to [OFTC](https://www.oftc.net/) under a brand new name. [#lxqt](irc://irc.oftc.net/lxqt) will be used for user support and general discussion while [#lxqt-dev](irc://irc.oftc.net/lxqt-dev) will be used for development-related discussion and commit notices.

Thanks to Simon Quigley and Alf Gaida for working on this transition.
