The LXQt team is proud to announce the release of lxqt-config 1.4.0.
The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt-config/releases).

Main changes:

 * Use lxqt-menu-data.
 * Fixed setting of primary monitor after a change in libkscreen.
 * Put cursor settings in ~/.Xresources (fixes the problem of not being able to set the cursor or its size when Xresources from `/etc` is read).
 * Corrected some typos.
 * Improved the message about default monitor settings.
 * Don't return uninitialized struct members.
