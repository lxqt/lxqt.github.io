 * Ensure `Escape` closes the popup of path-edit completer.
 * Treat zero-sized files based on their extensions.
 * Use "New file" as the default name for new files (especially after GLib 2.75.1).
 * Ensure toolbar background is shown behind path-bar.
 * Prevent long content search texts from widening search dialog.
