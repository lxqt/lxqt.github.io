We would like to announce the third batch of point releases regarding lxqt-build-tools.
All components have several improvements and bug fixes beside the fact that liblxqt has
now lxqt-build-tools as a the new dependency, so the packaging should not change much.

Important: As the LXQt version is provided by lxqt-build-tools the tools must be build first.

Please read the changelogs.
