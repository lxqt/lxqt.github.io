### xdg-desktop-portal-lxqt

Backend implementation of [xdg-desktop-portal](https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal#readme) (currently only [org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser](https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/#gdbus-org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser) API) is ready for releasing!

<blockquote>A portal frontend service for Flatpak and possibly other desktop containment frameworks.
 xdg-desktop-portal works by exposing a series of D-Bus interfaces known as portals under a well-known name   (org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop) and object path (/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop).
 The portal interfaces include APIs for file access, opening URIs, printing and others.</blockquote>
