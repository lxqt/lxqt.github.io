We're happy to start this blog in our website which until now was mostly only about release announcements.
We'll share here news, howtos, tipps&tricks and other things around LXQt.

Comments are not implemented as you can already discuss any LXQt related matters in [Discussions](https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/discussions). The easiest way to get updates is the good old rusty  [Rss Feed](https://lxqt-project.org/feed.xml).

Stay tuned!
