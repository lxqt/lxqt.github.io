The LXQt team releases obconf-qt 0.16.3.

Changes:

 * Added missing copyright info.
 * Bumped the minimum required version of cmake to 3.5.0 (to silence a compilation warning).
 * Translation updates.

<br/>
Obconf-Qt is not actively developed anymore, but code contributions
and bugfixes are still welcome.


The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/obconf-qt/releases).
