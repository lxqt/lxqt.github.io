<p>
LXQt is a lightweight Qt desktop environment.
</p>
<p>
It will not get in your way. It will not hang or slow down your system. It is focused on being a classic desktop with a modern look and feel.
</p>
<p>
LXQt has already been included in most Linux and BSD distributions so you may just try it out on your regular system or in a VM.<br>
More information about installing can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/lxde/lxqt/wiki/">LXQt GitHub wiki</a>.
</p>
<p>
Historically, LXQt is the product of the merge between LXDE-Qt, an initial Qt flavour of LXDE, and Razor-qt, a project aiming to develop a Qt based desktop environment with similar objectives as the current LXQt.<br>
LXQt was first supposed to become the successor of LXDE one day but as of 09/2016 both desktop environments will keep coexisting for the time being.<br>
More on this topic can be found on page <a href="https://github.com/lxde/lxqt/wiki/History">History</a> of the aforementioned wiki.
